# Usage: 
just add the values to the parameters. <br/>

Parameters:
- Purchase Price: one could browse in HAR to get a value for houses.

- Down Payment: this value is on you.

Granted these are annual charges, and they need to be divided by 12, but I did it with mindset of a monthly vision. but I might change my mind.
- Home Insurance Mo/: find out from House Insurance quotes, car's insurance sometimes offer this and if some even give you a discount.

# Important Notes:
- I am not a realtor, nor a Loan Officer., I did this just so I don't forget how to create websites from scratch and then publish them on the Internet. <br/>
- They are already websites calculators that do this but I was limited to what they want you to input, likewise, <br/>
I didn't  add Private mortgage insurance (PMI), because I assume one will be adding the 20% downpayment,
and potentially other parameters I don't know about.
- Is this the real deal? No. take this site with a grain of salt.
- suggestions are always welcome.
- Closing costs are not included in this page either, hence they are even more variables than just that.

# Languages used:
- HTML, CSS, JS, and for charts framework I used https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js <br/>
- graphics I designed them myself using `Stable Fusion` <br/>
- I also utilize ChatGPT4 and Claude, with my knowledge and guidance I was able to do this in about 4 days few hours afterwork. <br/>
